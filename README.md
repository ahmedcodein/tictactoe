# Tic Tac Toe

## 1. Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is an ancient board game. According to Wikipedia, the game goes back to 1300 BC (wikipedia). The game board is divided into 3-by-3 boxes. The game is designed to be played by two persons. Each person is designated either of two characters/symbols to play with. The players then take turns by placing the symbols in one of the nine boxes. Either player is able to place players designated symbols on three boxes arranged horizontally, vertically or diagonally is considered the game winner. In case, none of the players is unable to do so, the game is then a tie.

## 2. Development Process

The process followed by the author consists of five phases. These phases are presented below with a detailed account is presented in the subsequent sections.

Discuss how and why i choose particular project.

### 2.1. Project research and selection criteria

Project Research and Selection Criteria
In the research phase the author has conducted a brief search on easy to implement games for the purpose of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript together. Many resources can be found, the author however settled on the following article: https://www.codingnepalweb.com/best-javascript-games-for-beginners/. 
Among the 10 candidates, the author chooses to move with Tic Tac Toe due to three main reason:
1.	Simple User Interface with minimum graphics
2.	Average logic complexity
3.	Good enough of interactions between the DOM and the JavaScript to become familiar with the concept of DOM manipulation.


### 2.2. Project Objective

The main anticipated objective of developing this game is to become familiar with JavaScript programming and its interactions with HTML DOM.

#### 2.2.1. Website Owner Objectives

The owner objective is to build an online game that is easy to understand, interface with and play combined with some sort of challenge presented by score accumulation.

#### 2.2.2. Website Visitor Objectives

User objective converges with the site owner's in the sense of finding an online game that is easy to interact with in addition to the provision of some challenge in playing the game by accumulating score when played with a friend. 

### 2.3. Design Concept

#### 2.3.1. Website Requirements

Outline the key requirements for the website.

#### 2.3.2. Structure

Describe the structure of the website.

#### 2.3.3. Wireframes

This section is designed to provide a high-level overview about the early design thinking of the Game website. The main purpose of these wireframes is to aid the design of the HTML website Without delving into what style or how the JavaScript interacts with the HTML. The main expected outputs of these wireframes are:

- What is the preliminary layout of the website?
- What is the preliminary structure of the HTML page?
- What is the preliminary naming used for HTML elements IDs and Classes?

#### 2.3.3.1. Preliminary layout of the website

Using Balsamiq Wireframes, the Game page is presented in three different viewing senarios. These are Smartphone, Tablet and Desktop. 

- Smartphone Layout

- Tablet or Desktop Layout

#### 2.3.3.2. Preliminary structure of the HTML page

Following the wireframes' layout presented on section 2.3.3., the high-level html structure is constructed. The structure is shown in the image below. 

![Website's HTML structure](documentation/images/html-structure.png)

As shown in the figure above, the HTML structure is divided into three parts:

- Header: The header contains the title of the game.
- Main: The main contains three sections, these are: Setup Board, Game Board and Score board.
- Footer: The footer contains two types of information; these are links to the author's LinkedIn and GitHub websites.

#### 2.3.3.3. preliminary naming used for HTML elements IDs and Classes

The following image is devoted to give additional resolution to the previous subsection by elaborating further on the elements contained in the body of the HTML page. In addition, the image provides further color on the IDs and Classes naming strategy that the author intends to implement to develop the HTML page and subsequently will be used for the page styling and to manipulate the page by the JavaScript code.
